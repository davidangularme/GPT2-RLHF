# GPT2-RLHF
GPT-2 Text Generation with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) Implementation
This title encapsulates the main components and purpose of the code:
It uses GPT-2, a language model for text generation.
It implements Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
The goal is to improve text generation based on simulated human feedback.
The code demonstrates a complete pipeline that includes:
Loading and using the GPT-2 model
Generating baseline text outputs
Simulating human feedback
Implementing a custom environment for reinforcement learning
Training the model using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
Evaluating the model's performance before and after training

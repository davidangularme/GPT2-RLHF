Prompt: The future of AI is
Samples:
  - The future of AI is clear. In this space, we should have a set of tools that can help us work with data to create better, more efficient software.

We've already seen how we can use Google's AI engine to understand how
  - The future of AI is not settled. In order to make things happen, we need to understand the way the world works. This is where the great innovation comes in. AI has changed the way the world is used. The AI that is now in
  - The future of AI is in the realm of human experience. It is not only possible but very likely that humans will eventually have the ability to better understand and understand what is happening in our lives, and to learn more about our environment and to use it
  - The future of AI is in the hands of scientists, not the bureaucrats.

The next step is to begin to understand the effects of artificial intelligence on the future of humanity.

The key is the development of a better understanding of the relationship
  - The future of AI is not yet clear. In fact, some of the questions we're trying to answer might still be difficult, if not impossible. For example, does AI have to be able to learn to recognize human faces? And does it have

Prompt: In a world where
Samples:
  - In a world where we've seen so much from the likes of Michael Phelps and Bruce Lee, why would we expect to see more from the likes of Chris Evans, Chris Pratt, Mark Ruffalo and Adam Driver?

So what about the movies
  - In a world where the average American is a middle class with a steady income, that's an accomplishment that goes beyond simply looking for work. It's a way of life that makes Americans proud. And that means we need to make it a reality.
  - In a world where the people of the United States are working at home, there are many ways to get your hands on what you need.

So, here's what you can do to make your life easier for yourself.

Prompt: Climate change will
Samples:
  - Climate change will be accelerated by climate change alone and must be met by a process of social and economic change. This is why we must not wait for another generation to make their mark on the planet.

We must act now to protect our children
  - Climate change will lead to higher temperatures. And this will cause more food shortages. We don't need to wait for the next generation to adapt to climate change.

But we can and should.

The Climate Action Network and its allies have
  - Climate change will affect our ability to manage our environment, and that is why it's imperative for governments to take action to address this issue."

"Climate change is a problem that we can solve. It's not just a problem that we can
  - Climate change will be a global problem that will be a worldwide problem," the study said.

The scientists said climate change is likely to take decades to reverse, but they also said the long-term implications could be significant.

  - The key to happiness is a happy mind.

I've heard people say that it's impossible to be happy if you're not happy. Well, I'm not crazy about that. I'm just that I don't believe that there's anything
  - The key to happiness is the absence of suffering, and that is why we see so many people suffering.

In fact, there are so many people suffering today who have nothing to do with happiness. There is no happiness in the world, no

Prompt: Technology's impact on society
Samples:
  - Technology's impact on society is so massive that it would have been impossible for any person to have predicted the impact of the climate change on their lives.

We know that for many people, the impact of climate change is a life-threatening issue
  - Technology's impact on society has been to accelerate the development of technology to improve the efficiency of the production of things.

For example, in the last year or so, the total cost of a car has quadrupled in just two years. This
